In the morning I entered Iran. After being sent back and forth for a little until I had collected all my stamps I only needed an insurance for my motorbike. Unfortunately the computer was broken (as they always are) so I had to wait for two hours. Meanwhile a nice Australian going in the other direction stopped and we exchanged some hints on our respective destination countries. I exchanged money for a fairish rate and became instant sevenfold millionaire. 
Even though it had started to rain I decided to take the direct route to Tabriz, crossing the mountains instead of going around them. The road quality was a lot better than in Armenia, so even the small yellow roads were no problem. The last few kilometers up to the pass were covered in clouds with a visibility of about 50m. Luckily the only other car on the road was going far slower than me so I could take my time.

I had heard that fuel in Iran was cheap, but when the clerk asked for 13.000 (about 0.2 €) for 13 liters I was a bit surprised. So was he when I handed him a 20.000 Note. After exchanging some very meaningless gestures, he just went ahead and fiddled 130.000 from my stack of money. The official currency in Iran is Rial. But to make things ~~easier~~ more complicated people only talk about tooman, where one tooman is equal to ten rials. Prices are sometimes written in Rial, sometimes in tooman, you have to guess. This promised to be interesting. Nevertheless, 13 liters of petrol for less than 2 € was still fine with me.
In Tabriz I found the hostel the Australian guy had suggested where I met three French cyclists. Also there were two more motorcycles from Austria and Germany, but I never met their owners. The next morning I went shopping and had breakfast with the French guys. On the Internet I had been in contact with Mr. F., a student of tourism management who was learning German. We met in the afternoon and went around the city. I received a free tour to some sites and he got to practice German. Win-Win. 
The next day, a Spanish bike was parked in the yard. I met the owner, Mr. E. and we went to see ~~Hobbiton~~ Kandovan together. We skillfully escaped the rain and found a nice restaurant in Kandovan. After everybody had taken pictures with us and I spoke some french with some Canadian Iranians, we went to walk around the village. In Kandovan, houses are hewn into the rock of the mountain. Nowadays many houses are extended with bricks, but we were able to have a look into some traditional ones, too.

In the evening, Mr. F, my guide from the day before invited me for dinner to a friends house. We walked through the city and he showed me a few more things while buying some ingredients. Sadly neither of his friends spoke German or English (or French), so he had to translate all the time. Nevertheless I had a nice evening.
In the morning, Mr. E. (The spanish guy) and I went to see the prayer for the end of Ramadan. As all practicing Muslims seemed to go to the prayer, no mosque in Tabriz would have been able to hold all of them. So a road was blocked where everybody gathered. Mr. E. and me, both of us obvious western tourists, kept to the side but were mentioned to come closer by some policemen. We watched the prayer from a crossroad, where men prayed on one road and women prayed behind them on another (in Islam, traditionally men and women pray separately). It was a very impressive and peaceful ceremony. We noticed that mostly older people were present and assumed that, as in European countries, younger people tend to be not as religious.

My Iranian Friend in Germany, Mr. A., had made a detailed plan of which route I should take and what I should see in Iran (Thank you very much!). Following this, I set off in the morning to see the blue mosque in Tabriz. Sadly due to the combination of my phones mediocre camera and the light in the mosque, you will have to wait for the next mosque for pictures.
Next stop was Ardabil where I visited ~~the next mosque~~ the mausoleum of Sheikh Safi.

I continued east and found a camping ground near Astara at the Caspian Sea. After I had been waved through without paying entrance fee, I stopped at a small hut to ask the people where I could set up my tent and was promptly invited for tea and supper. Also, as everybody could easily identify me as a tourist, a fanclub of some 4-12 year old girls formed. Even though nobody seemed to understand any English, I was able to set up my “Chador” at a not-so-quiet corner and ‘enjoyed’ some Persian music while I tried to sleep at 32°C with 70% humidity.
