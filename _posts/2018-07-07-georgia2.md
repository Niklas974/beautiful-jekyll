My plan was to enter Iran on the 12th of June which left me with a couple of days to spend in Georgia or Armenia. I decided to take a trip to the north of Georgia to check out the Caucasus Mountains. The road led up the mountains in switchback curves, unfortunately it did not only grow cooler with increasing height, but the weather also changed for the worse. I had to change in and out of my raingear a lot and was not able to take many pictures. At the highest pass at around 2400m the temperature dropped to a chilling 9° C.

After sleeping in a nice and cheap hotel in Stepanzminda I set off in the morning to see the Holy Trinity Church. But due to bad road conditions and a lot of 4x4 taxis on the same road I turned around half-way and decided to go to Juta, a very small village in the mountains, instead.

In Juta I was invited for tea by some Georgian Tourists who thought I am crazy for doing this trip. I enjoyed the landscape but decided to go back to Tbilisi after a short break.

On the way back I saw another motorcycle parked at the side of the road and stopped to say Hello. It turned out to be another German rider on his Africa Twin, riding from Russia to Tbilisi. We had just begun to talk when a third German rider on his BMW 1200GS going the other way stopped. We chatted for a few minutes about Georgia and our Gear (realizing that there are a few things that almost all ADV riders use. Heidenau K60 Scout tires for example)

I stayed in Tbilisi that night and set off towards Armenia the next morning. After a few kilometers the road was blocked by police, because some 200 BMWs where having a ride. As I’m on a BMW bike I joined in and rode through Tbilisi on somewhat closed off roads. Unfortunately does not seem to have a lot of authority in Georgia and other drivers just ignored the blockades. When the BMW ride turned off the main road, I continued to the Armenian Border on my own.
In Georgia everything that is able to, is allowed to go on the road. There is no safety inspection and of course also no emissions inspection. This implies that a lot of trucks have thick black smoke coming from their exhaust and you need plan your breathing when overtaking them. Also almost all cars seem to come from Germany or the United Kingdom (steering wheel on the right hand side). Georgians don’t even bother to remove the old caption, so a lot of cars look like this:

At the border to Armenia I met a couple from Germany in their VW Golf. They came to Armenia because “They would not let us into Azerbaijan without a visa” and planned to “continue from Armenia to Turkey”. Good luck with that. I don’t claim to have my trip planned out completely, but I was really surprised of how unprepared you can go. The border from Armenia to Turkey is closed for 25 years.
In Armenia I bought insurance for 7.000 Dram (about 12 €) after negotiating the price from 12.000 Dram and set off towards Lake Sevan. I had decided to skip Yerevan because I wanted to spend more time in Iran and rather come back to Armenia another time.

After having dinner in a “genuine German” restaurant (definitely not genuine German!) I want to Lake Sevan for camping. I waited for all other guests to leave and set up my tent. I was on the western shore of the lake from where you are supposed to be able to see a beautiful sunrise, so I set my alarm for 5am. Sadly it started raining in the middle of the night, so there was no sunrise to be seen.

I rode through some great landscapes, even though the roads in Armenia are in really bad shape and a lot of potholes are waiting for you after every bend. I did not go to Yerevan, but in rural areas motorcycles don’t seem to exist. As I probably was the first motorcycle rider they ever saw, all dogs barked at me and most of them started running after me. Usually I was fast enough not to care about them, but once I came out of a bend and a dog ran in front of my bike. I did not run it over but could not move my foot fast enough so I kicked it while going 60 km/h. As there were three more dogs coming I could not stop but in the mirror the dog seemed alright.

Also in Armenia I learned a new traffic rule: If a car or truck uses its left hand side indicator this could mean that it wants to turn left (obviously) or it could mean that the car will stay right but that it is safe to overtake. Coincidentally this rule also seems to apply in Mexico, as [Ed March](https://www.youtube.com/user/c90adventures) describes in his latest video (Great guy, the videos about his travels if you have a couple of hours to spare).
In the evening I found a nice hotel near the Iranian Border that had a workshop in the basement where the owner was able to lathe a replacement for my broken of mirror mounting on his 1970s Russian made lathe engine. He was so skilled that he was able to cut a thread with the right slope by hand, simply by adjusting the speed of the machine.
