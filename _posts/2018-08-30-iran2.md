After a very warm and humid night at the camping ground I really needed a shower, but having seen the state of the toilets I decided not to search for a shower but instead continue south and look for a public swimming pool. 
On the way to Rascht, I stopped at the side of the road to check my GPS navigation when a car stopped. The guy was friendly and spontaneously led me to a hotel where he arranged for a room where I could take a shower. When I came back to my bike he had ordered lunch for me, paid for it and left. Thank you! 
I continued to Massoleh, a touristy village where the houses are built uphill with the roof of one house forming the yard / footpath for the next level of houses. It was warm and very touristy so I only spent half an hour walking around and then continued towards Ramsar.

As it had started to rain I wanted to find a hotel but instead met a nice guy who led me to his brothers guesthouse. I booked a whole two bedroom flat for about 10 â‚¬ for one night. In the evening the brother and me went out for dinner, he took me to the local shopping mall (just like any shopping mall in europe, but not all products seemed genuine...), to the beach and for pomegranate juice. 

Ramsar is stuck in between the caspian sea and the mountains and is a tourist destination for Iranians from the south. In the morning, my newly made friend took me to the cable car going up the mountains. Unfortunately they use small two-person cabins with glass windows that go in the direct sun uphill for about 15 minutes. So I got a firsthand experience of how a greenhouse must feel for tomatoes. Nice view from the mountain, though.

Afterwards I continued towards Teheran. I ignored the no-motorbikes-on-the-freeway signs and was waved through at the toll both without paying (they don't have a rate for motorcycles anyway). Unfortunately it was the end of the holidays so every single car from Tehran was on the two laned road going the same direction as I was. As the road goes through the mountains it had a lot of curves and switchbacks so it was hard to overtake the cars and I had the chance to enjoy 100km of traffic jam. The views were really nice, my phone was not able to capture them appropriately, though. I arrived late in Karaj (about 50km west of Tehran). Mr. M, the guy I had met in Tblisi had invited me to stay with him and his with Mrs. E (actually it's Mrs. somethingelse, but I'm using first names, so it's Mrs. E in here). I had my own room where they prepared a traditional iranian bed for me (thin mattress, directly on the floor. It is packed every morning and unfolded every evening). 

Mr. M had taken the next day off work, so we cleaned my bike and went into Tehran to have my fork seals replaced. We spent about five hours in the workshop helping and watching the mechanic replacing the fork seals, doing an oil change and repairing a few minor things. In the end I paid more for three liters of imported european oil than for the mechanics work. 

Traffic in Tehran is crazy. I have ridden and driven cars in Istanbul, Tbilisi and Indonesia, but Tehran is the next level. Not quite India-level (for what I have heard) but from my german perspective already pretty crazy. Traffic is very dynamic, lane changes are frequent (and without indicators). The right hand side lane is not really for driving but for stopping without warning or turning off the road (again, without indicator). I have been in Iran for a total of five weeks and I did not understand how roundabouts work. People mostly go in one direction but there does not seem to be a rule about who may go first: people in the roundabout or those coming in from the right. Mostly I tried to find a car and hid behind it to sneak through the roundabout ~~without~~ with minimised risk of being run over. Motorcycles are not allowed on most of the freeways going through Tehran, ~~because I am an ignorant tourist, I just ignored those signs~~ unfortunately I never noticed the big red signs announcing these restrictions. These roads are quite civilised, they have a lot of traffic jams but it is easy to filter in between the cars, even with a big bike with luggage on the back. Very chaotic are the small roads where motorcycles go all over the place. They literally ignore all traffic rules and go on the wrong hand side of the road, in the bus lane (in both directions!) and turn on and off the road wherever they like (hitting the brakes very hard, without indicating and mostly without a working brake light). All this chaotic driving is only possible because everybody is used to it and everybody is very alert and always prepared to react to other drivers crazy maneuvers. Driving medium-crazy (I did adapt to the local rules - to some degree) is thus saver than in Germany. Filtering through cars moving cars is absolutely no problem in Iran because everybody is aware of motorcycles doing so, whereas you cannot do this in Germany because nobody expects a motorcycle coming through. 
All in all, driving in Tehran is a lot of fun, but also very exhausting because you need to be focused 100%. 

In the evening Mr. M had an appointment, so Mrs. E and me went to visit his uncle. It was a nice evening with the additional challenge that only Mrs. E knew a little english and we had to communicate with hand and feet and google translator, otherwise. We played card and I taught everybody to count in german. 

I stayed with Mr. M and Mrs. E for a total of five days. In that time I went to Tehran a couple of times to do some sightseeing (Milad Tower, Shahs Palaces (green and white), visited Mr. Ms friends to watch football (Irans vs Spain (0:1)), and generally relax. In the evening of the last day we decided to search for a strange sound on my bike, which turned out to be harder than expected. We took the bike apart (see the photo below) but did not find the source of the sound. It would take a couple of thousand kilometers until I discovered where it came from...
