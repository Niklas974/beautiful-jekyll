After setting off from my couch surfing host, I took the Bosporus bridge to Asia. My superior navigation skills allowed me to ride without using my phone for navigation. A few minutes later I found myself in the middle of a small market with lots of people staring at me angrily. I found my way back on the highway and rode out of Istanbul.

As I had been to Turkey before, I had decided to cross it rather quickly taking the road along the black sea. After a few miles, I thus turned north and reached the black sea in the afternoon

I enjoyed the ride along the coast and found a nice restaurant for dinner. The owners turned out to grow their own food and raise their own cattle. I was allowed to sleep in the garden and made friends with their dog. The next day I rode to Samun where I had found a couch surfing host. I stayed with Mr. E, his wife and his 6 month old son. We had interesting conversations and enjoyed a nice walk along the pier at night (off which I forgot to take a picture).

In the morning we had breakfast with homemade bread and homemade yogurt and I set off to Trabzon. Whilst stopping for fuel I saw another German motorcycle pass by and may have gone a little too fast in order to catch up with him. Luckily the police caught me in a 90s zone and not a few kilometers earlierâ€¦ They were really friendly but still had to give me a ticket for doing 107km/h. They told me I could pay it at the next bank. As nobody had replied to my couch surfing request for Trabzon and the city felt really crowded I went on and found a nice hotel with a great view on the sunset across the black sea.

Many people in Turkey keep Ramadan, so I was the only person at breakfast in the morning. I ordered a regional dish which turned out to be cheese fondue with corn. Awesome. My plan was to go to Batumi in Georgia that day but as I was up early I decided to take a detour and try to ride up the mountain. There is a small white road on the map, so what could possibly go wrong?

The small white road actually was more of a rocky dirt track and with no offroading experience whatsoever, it took me about 500m before I fell. I cracked and broke off my right hand side mirror, lost an indicator, bent the solid steel brake pedal and dropped the bike on my right foot. Luckily, I only got a few bruises. After getting myself unstuck and inspecting the damage, I decided to continue upwards and was rewarded with ~~an astonishing view~~ a lot of fog. On the way down I dropped my bike twice and decided I would need some more offroad training for Mongolia.

At the border I queue-jumped all the trucks and squeezed past most of the cars and was able to pay my speeding ticket. After I arrived in Georgia, I had to find insurance for my bike. I exchanged money even though the clerk for some reason did not seem to understand that if he advertised 2.33 Lari per US-Dollar (which already was a rip-off), he should not put 2.03 into his calculator. I quickly learned that Georgians drive like maniacs, which is especially annoying if you miss your right mirror, and very carefully rode to Batumi where I found a hotel.
