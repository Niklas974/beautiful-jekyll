![Landscape on the way to the border][img1] Landscape on the way to the border

I set off to the border of Turkmenistan earlyish and rode to Bajgiran. I filled up my bike, exchanged my remaining Rials for USD and set off for the border. The Iranian side of the border was pretty straightforward, as soon as I had found the right office to start at. I left Iran around noon and arrived right on time for the Turkmen to start their lunchbreak.I had to go through immigration first and left my bike outside. As I had heard a few scary stories about Turkmenistan and specifically this border crossing*, I was prepared for a few suprises. 
After paying my 14 USD for immigration, I continued to get my bike processed. I was led to the first office, where an old guy calculated the fee for my bike. I don’t like to pay for entering a country but he seemed to calculate correctly. Insurance + road tax for the distance + fuel subsidize compensation + other stuff = 64 USD. OK, I knew what to expect. After handing me the paper he asked for 10 USD. Being the dumb tourist, the conversation went like this:

Clerk *handing me the paper*: “give me 10 USD”  
Me: *gives him a 10 $ note* “Can I get a receipt please?”  
Clerk: *stuffing the money in his pocket*: “what?”  
Me: *imitating writing something on paper*: “A receipt for the money, please.”  
Clerk: “no, receipt no. Is for cai (tea)”  
Me: “No sir, I don’t pay for your cai. Please give me a receipt.”  
Clerk: “No receipt, is tip for me.”  
Me: *pointing at his pocket and gesturing him to give back the money*: “No receipt, no dollar!”  
Clerk: *reluctantly hands me back my 10 USD*  

My new “friend” then escorted me to the “bank” where I paid my 64 USD + 4 USD bank fee. As I got a stamp for my collection I did not argue with that. After that I was escorted to the veterinary who asked me something I forgot, stamped my paper and asked for a tip. I, being a very dumb tourist, smiled at him and shook his hand instead of putting some dollar in.
I went to the doctor next. He seemed to have heard about the dumb tourist, so my visit went like this:

Doctor: *measures the temperature of my forehead*: “very good”  
Me: *thinking about why the temperature of my forehead is significant*  
Doctor: *stamps my paper*: “I medicine doctor. I money”  
Me: *taking the paper*: “Nice to meet you, I’m a computer engineer”  
Doctor: *remembering that I’m stupid*: “I need dollar”  
Doctor: *offering his hand to put some money in*: “Give me Money”  
Me: *shaking his hand*: “Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice day”  
Doctor: *gripping my hand stronger*: “Doctor. Money. Doctor. Money. Doctor. Money”  
Me: *smiling at him while shaking his hand*: “Nice to meet you, Doctor Money. See you next time”  
Doctor: *looking like he does not know what to say*  
Me: *leaving the room*  

After managing to complete my stamp collection without paying any “tips”, I went to get my luggage inspected. They asked if I carried any weapons, drugs or drones but only inspected the top of my luggage. Because I conveniently forgot about the cigarette lighter connector under my seat, they could not equip me with a GPS tracking system and sent me off without one.
The whole procedure at the border crossing took about 3 hours.
All in all I have to say that all the military guys in uniform were nice and behaved correctly, only the civil workers asked for tips. I always behaved nicely but as I don’t like tipping officials, I successfully talked myself out when they asked for it. The dialogues above did happen like this and are only slightly exaggerated ;-)

I was told not to stop or take photos within the first 30km. As I had read and heard about strict laws in Turkmenistan and I did not want to get in conflict with the strict one-party authoritarian dictatorship government, I tried to actually abide all the laws, including the speed limit.

Aşgabat is a special place. I rode into the city on a brand new, perfectly clean six-lane road. Passing new, modern buildings painted in perfectly clean white. As Aşgabat is built into the desert, there is enough room for generous spacing in between buildings to plant trees and parks.

It took me a few minutes to figure out, what was wrong: There was nobody there. I was the only person driving on the 6 lane roads. Continuing into the city, I did find a few other drivers but also a few more oddities. Somebody had built a full size olympia stadium including a monorail around it. There have never been olympic games in Aşgabat and there are none planned to take place there.

After searching for a while, I found something that was not brand new. The hotel I had picked. It looked ok-ish from the outside, but the room they offered was probably last cleaned when Aşgabat was still under soviet reign. I politely declined and started my search for an alternative hotel. As I had read that there was no internet available for tourists, I had picked out a few choices. Unfortunately, they were all booked out and I ended up in the basement in some janitors chamber that was neither clean nor had a window. But knowing that camping was illegal around Aşgabat and there is a curfew at night, I agreed to pay 52 $ and just use my mattress instead of the bed.
I had a decent chinese dinner and made some guy very happy when I allowed him to twist the throttle on my bike. Motorbikes seem to not really exist in Turkmenistan.

In the morning, I found a nice café on iOverlander where I had a decent breakfast. I rode around Aşgabat for a while to get an impression of the city. Upon passing the impressing presidents palace I decided that it would be nice to take a photo. I turned around to approach some policemen to ask if it was allowed, as I had heard that some buildings may not be photographed. When they saw me turning around they started running towards me, waiving their arms to show me that I should turn around and leave RIGHT NOW. I decided that playing the dumb tourist may not be helpful in this situation and left Aşgabat towards the north.

Even though Turkmenistan basically only has one road crossing the country north-south, there was very little traffic. I only came across some trucks and a few camels.

I was stopped at a police station and after checking my passport and documents, the officer was very kind in helping me to find the track to darvaza crater by assigning a local motorbiking youth to lead me. As the sand track turned off a bit further south, my guide decided it would be best to cross a short piece of sand directly. He regretted that, soon. It was the second time I ever took my motorbike offroad (some 12.000 km into my trip) so it only took me about 20m to get stuck and drop my bike.
I did manage to get to the sand track though and only dropped my bike one more time within the 8km to the crater.
After explaining to my guide that $20 seemed just a bit too much for following him for 10 minutes, I spotted a tent with two adventure bikes parked next to it. Marta and Lukas from Warsaw (Poland) invited me for dinner. I set up my tent next to theirs. They blog about their trip in polish [here](https://dreamcatchers.pl/).

The [darvaza crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvaza_gas_crater), also known as the “gate to hell” is a 70m diameter hole in the desert where natural gas is burning since the 1970s. It is very impressive, especially at night.

In the morning we started early back along the sand track towards the main road. I managed to follow Marta and Lukas without dropping my bike even once. Back at the road I found my rear mud guard hanging loose and simply ripped it off completely. It turned out that this also fixed the strange noise I had heard the last couple of thousand kilometers and was not able to locate before.

Riding north towards the border crossing to Uzbekistan, the road got worse and we finally came down to slaloming around the potholes at about 30km/h. As the Turkmenistan visa is not only date specific but also border crossing specific, we had to split up for the last 30km. I had picked wrong and struggled through 20km of sandy construction site to reach the border.
Crossing was easy, even though both Turkmen and Uzbek Border Agents were confused when I showed two different German passports, one with the Visa for Turkmenistan and one with the Visa for Uzbekistan.
In the first city in Uzbekistan I exchanged some money, bought an insurance (not sure if it’s worth the paper it is printed on, but at least I have something to show to the police) and a SIM card, I took a long ride in the dark to Khiva, where Marta and Lukas were waiting for me in a hostel.


* I use iOverlander on Android, travelers can comment on places. Difficult border crossings usually have a good explanation of what to expect. It helps a lot not to get ripped off!
