In the morning I had a very short walk through the old town of Khiva. I would have liked to stay a little longer but due to the extra time I had spent in Iran, my visa was only valid for four more days. As Marta and Lukas had planned a route through Uzbekistan and I hadn't, I just joined them. We set off on a 450km ride to Buxara along the border with Turkmenistan and through the Desert / Steppe. Although I had fueled up before we left, 450km was just about the maximum I could squeeze out of my tank, for some reason nobody had built a fuel station on the way.

In Buxara we found a nice guesthouse where I shared my room with an irish guy. We took two days to walk around the city and enjoy the architecture.

After relaxing for two days we continued to Samarkand where we found a guesthouse full of european cyclists, most of them french. I was genuinely impressed by how they managed to cross Turkmenistan within 4 days by bike. In Samarkand I visited Registan, a very impressive plaza with three even more impressive Madrasas (islamic schools) around it.
