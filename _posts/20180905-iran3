My plan for Iran included a trip to the south to see some of the historical cities. To do so, I set off not-so-early the ext to towards Hamedan. Again I ~~ignored~~ did not see the no motorbikes on the freeway signs and enjoyed the high quality road. Unfortunately Iran is a warm country, especially in the end of june. The thermometer at my bike read 39° C. In the shade that is, unfortunately at the freeway there is no shade. I arrived in Hamedan in the evening, found a hostel (500.000 Rial (about 6 €) per night) and had a walk through the city.

I had an early start in the morning and set off going north towards Alisadr cave. [wiki link here]. The cave is a touristy place, but still worth visiting. It is impressively big and they have small pedalo boats whith wich a guide has to pull three small boats with tourists through the 11km waterways of the cave. As it was formed by water, there are impressive stalactite and other limestone formations to be seen, some colourfully lit with LEDs.

I continued my journey south and arrived in Khorramabad too late to visit the castle. I got a hotel room with aircondition and had a walk through the city. When I started at 9 am the next morning, my thermometer read 24° C.

Going south from Khorramabad I came within 50km from the border to Iraq in the valley with some 3000 year old buildings. Because some very intelligent guy planned his trip for southern Iran in the beginning of July, the thermometer climbed up to 48°C, which is too warm to look at any old stones. I basically rode from climatised fuel station to climatised fuel station, having closed all vents in my gear to keep out the heat and just enjoy being boiled in my own sweat. Again, all Iranians I met prooved to be the friendliest people ever, basically dragging me into their stores and refusing to accept payment for cold water or food. One peach-transporting guy at the freeway mentioned me to stop to fill up my nice-and-warm water bottle from his water cooler and made me wear his cold-water soaked headscarf for a few minutes. 
In the afternoon I arrived in Bandar e Mahshahr. Because my navigation app could not tell the difference between the city and the industrial harbour, I was stopped at the latter by the security guards. They were really nice and invited me into their climatised office to cool down. Their boss spoke english and I got to refill my water bottles and they ordered dinner for me (which I was not allowed to pay for). After talking for about half an hour, the chief guard invited me to stay at his house for the night. I agreed and followed him into town. I joined him for his english class and we had some for second dinner at the sea in the evening. In the morning he took me out for an iranian breakfast which turned out to be sheep feet and brain. It did not taste bad and I would gladly eat it again, but rather not for breakfast. 
The ride to Shiraz was f***ing hot again, with somewhere around 47°C and the landscape turned desertly. I tried to find a hotel with safe parking when it turned dark, but had to continue to Shiraz. There I found a nice hotel and got a very secure parking position.

Shiraz is one of the must-see cultural touristy cities and I spent two days trying to visit all places suggested by my iranian friend Mr. A and the lonely planet guide.

For my second night in Shiraz I was invited to surf the couch at a couple teaching Electronics at University. We had nice conversation but unfortunately not very long time to spend together. The next day I continued to Marvdasht, a small city 50km from Shiraz. There I went couchsurfing again. My host took me on a tour to Persepolis and some other sites the next day. Persepolis was the capital of the the old persian empire some 2500 years ago, until it was burned down by Alexander the Great. The ruins are still very impressive and they offer a set of VR goggles that you can use to see how some of the buildings used to look like.

I continued towards Yazd the next day and stopped at Pasargardae, the old Persian capital before Persepolis. Sadly the sights are spread quite far apart and due to the heat I did not walk around for a long time. Upon exiting Pasargardae, I noticed another overlanders bike and met Mr. G from Brasil who is actually riding the same bike as I do, just not the Dakar version. As he is paragliding during his travel, he is carrying so much luggage that I don't even know how he fits onto the bike. We had lunch together before I continued on the way through the desert towards Yazd. I was stopped by the police for the first time in Iran, but they were very friendly and I was allowed to continue after I showed my motorcycle papers and answered a few questions. I think they were just interested in my bike. In Yazd it took me some time to find my way through the small alleys to my hotel. 
Yazd is located in the desert, with the architecture of the oldtown reflecting this. All buildings have the same height and have some kind of wind towers that are used to direct any wind that down into the building. It also has a famous system of freshwater canals that was used to transport water into and within the city. 
In Yazd I used Couchsurfing to meet Mr. A, a student of Architecture who took a day off university to show me the most important sights in the city. We went to Masjed-e Jameh Mosque, the Bazaar, and a few other sights. Due to his specialisation in restauration of old buildings, Mr. A was very knowledegeable and I also enjoyed his artistic point of view. In the evening we had very good dinner with regional food (I tried minced camel) and enjoyed the sunset over the city.

The next day I had a very windy ride through the desert to Isfahan. I even saw a vew small tornados crossing the road. At the Hotel in Isfahan I met an Austrian couple, Peter and Claudia who are riding two-up on a big VStrom 1000. They make videos about the countries they have visited, you can find them on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZxYdFmxHWcWtMvdIFSSsmg) and on their [blog](https://roadsup.com). In Isfahan I walked around the bazaar, Naqsh-e Jahan Square, Shah Mosque, the bridges over the river (see below), Van Cathedral (an Armenian cathedral, one of very few existing chruches in Iran) and got a thorough presentation of the available carpets at a carpet store. I had dinner with Peter and Claudia and enjoyed being able to talk German.

I rode back to Tehran the next day, where for the first time a policeman tried to explain to me that I was not allowed to use the freeway. Sadly I spontaneously forgot most of my english and after I asked him which other route I should take (there are none), he just let me continue on the freeway. In Tehran I met Mr. E (the spanish motorbiker I had previously met in Tabriz) to talk about routes and do some planning for our upcoming journeys through the Pamir to Mongolia. Also it became clear that, due to a series of unfortunate events, my Turkmenistan visa would not arrive from Germany on time and that I would have to reapply in Tehran. 
Luckily, Mr. M and Mrs. E were happy to host me again.
