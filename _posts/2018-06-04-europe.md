About to start in Karlsruhe

Starting off on May 25th I made it 6 km to my first stop. At my local motorcycle workshop I had some excessive oil removed (which would otherwise get into the engine intake and damage the air filter). Whilst trying to get back up onto my loaded bike I dropped it. Very promising start for my trip. Luckily no one noticed and I was able to pick up the bike without public shame…

I then rode to lake chiemsee where after looking for some time, I found a nice hidden camping spot.

In the morning I got some breakfast at a local bakery and found a beach at the lake where I went for a cold and thus short swim and enjoyed the last german pretzel for some time. My initial idea was to go through Austria, Hungary, Romania to Bulgaria. But driving towards Salzburg I thought that it might be nice to go over the Alps instead of around. At the motorway intersection I changed lanes a couple of times and then decided to take the southern route. Not being bound to a route and literally deciding in the last seconds felt like a good start to my trip. That day I rode through the Alps via Villach and into Slovenia.

Did you know the Austrians named a village after me? 

In the following three days I went through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria to Turkey. I tried to find a couch surfing host a few times but it was too short notice and a lot of hosts were on vacation themselves. 

For Istanbul I had better luck regarding couch surfing and had two offers and one guy who wanted to meet me. Because Turkey is not in the EU, my mobile data roaming ended in Bulgaria and I had to look for open wifi to communicate with my couch surfing hosts. 
I have been to Turkey before and have driven cars in Istanbul. I remember that being a lot of fun but was a little afraid of not having a protective metal frame around me. Coming into Istanbul I hit traffic. Luckily I understood the local traffic rules quickly: 

1. The distance to be kept is 1/2 of your speedometer. The speedometer is about 7cm in diameter. 
2. You can drive on the shoulder of the road, if you are on a motorcycle, have a big black Mercedes or if you have emergency vehicle lighting (which a suspicious amount of small and old cars have...) 
3. Motorcycles may squeeze through any gap, even if they don't physically fit. 
4. Indicators are mainly for decoration. They may be used when turnimg, but never for changing lanes!

Playing by these rules I quickly reached central Istanbul where I found free wifi. The first couch surfing host bailed on me but luckily a very nice Sudanese guy offered to host me. After managing the steepest road I have ever seen and finding safe parking for my bike I arrived just in time for dinner (he and his roommate keep Ramadan, so they had to wait for 8:30pm to eat). They live in a students dormitory in Beşiktaş and have an amazing view towards Taksim. After dinner we went out and had çay by the water.

I spent the next day walking around the city center (sultanahmed) and met a nice german speaking medicine student who showed me around. After dinner with my couch surfing host and his other roommate (a german girl) we went out for çay and had a really interesting discussion about world politics. Thanks for hosting me!

On day 7 I packed my stuff, got my bike from protected parking and set off to Asia.
