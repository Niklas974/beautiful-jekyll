I stayed in Tehran for another two weeks waiting for my Turkmenistan visa. I spent the time writing blog posts, taking care of my bike, writing a job application for when I‘m back in Germany and spending time with my hosts and their friends. I took time to visit Tehran, where I went to see the National Jewelry Collection (very impressive), the Golestan Palace (not as impressive compared to Isfahan) and other sights.
For one weekend Mr. M organised a hiking tour for a group of his friends and me. We left Tehran in the evening by car and went north to a small village near Astara. We stopped in the morning to see the sunrise over the black sea.

We continued into the forest near the border to Azerbaijan, parked our cars and began hiking up the mountain. It was very hot and humid and because we had only slept a little bit in the car, we only made it half way up. Luckily some locals had made it their business to transport ~~lazy~~ exhausted tourists up the mountain on the back of their 4x4 trucks. We put our bags on the pickup and tried to find a safe spot for standing. The way up was quite an experience. The locals told us, that the “road” was built in the 70ies by “the Germans”. It turned out to be a gravel/dirt/sand road with brutal inclination angles both upwards and sideways. The driver knew the road and was not paid for the time spent… It felt like a rollercoaster ride, just without seatbelts, or seats. And without the rails but with 30m drops on one side of the road, instead.
We walked the last part to a small hut where we stayed for the night. As it still was very hot, we took a quick shower under a waterfall.

In the morning we climbed the last 150m to the top of the waterfall, where Mr. M, who is a certified climbing instructor, installed equipment to lower us on a rope down the 80m cliff next to the waterfall.

We spent a another night in a village where we had parked our cars. Unfortunately, the tap water everybody told us was drinkable was not. I did not enjoy the car ride back to Tehran…

After another couple of days in Tehran, my Turkmenistan visa was finally ready and I set off east. Mr. M accompanied me to Semnan, where we found that it was Friday and thus most tourist attractions where closed. Luckily it was mens-day at the local swimming pool and so we enjoyed a couple of hours in the waterslide park.

As it was really warm near Semnan, I decided to cross the mountains, hoping that it would not be too humid on the north side. Sadly it was, but the landscape was really beautiful.

I continued east towards Bojnurd through a national park. Some signs about local wildlife made me change my mind about camping…

I spent one night in Bojnurd and another in Quchan, where I found some very cool sheep:
