## Motorcycle
I ride a 2003 [BMW F650 GS Dakar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F_series_single-cylinder#2000%E2%80%932007:_F650GS,_F650GS_Dakar,_and_G650X) which I bought in autumn of 2017 with 20.000 km on the clock.
It is a single cylinder machine with 650cm³ which produces 37 kW (50 hp). I added some things before starting

Things I added:
* SW Motech engine guard (happy)
* SW Motech bash plate (happy, SW Motech sent me free replacement rubber dampeners after the trip)
* Barkbuster handguards (happy, although not a lot of space to the windscreen in full lock)
* Touratech radiator guards (not happy, broke and startet ratteling on the way. Got my money back at the end, though)
* SW Motech lower and wider footpegs (very happy)
* Touratech Topcase holder (happy)

After checking out the Adventure Spec Magadan bags, which I could not get to sit properly on my bike, I ordered a set oft MoskoMoto bags (Backcountry 35l set, 2x 4l addon pockets and the 60l duffel for the back (which I hope to use as a backpack when I park the bike)). They are the best quality item I have ever bought in my life. Not cheap but they seem to be indistructable - although I have not tried hard.

## Camping
* Tent: MSR Elixir 2 (happy)
* Cooker: MSR Whisperlite (happy)
* Chair: Helinox chair one (happy, although not really needed)

## Riding Gear
* Daytona Travel Star (happy)
* Büse OpenRoad Evo jacket and pants (happy)
* Held Summertime II light gloves (happy)
* Vanucci VC-1 winter gloves (happy)
* Schuberth E1 Helmet with Senca SC10u bluetooth system (happy, although the helmet did have minor problems after the trip. Schuberth did a free refurbishment, thanks!)
* Garmin Inreach Explorer + GPS tracker and SOS device (happy)
