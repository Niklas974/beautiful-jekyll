## Motorcycle
I ride a 2003 [BMW F650 GS Dakar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_F_series_single-cylinder#2000%E2%80%932007:_F650GS,_F650GS_Dakar,_and_G650X) which I bought in autumn with 20.000 km on the clock.
It is a single cylinder machine with 650cm³ which produces 37 kW (50 hp). I added some things before starting

(photo coming soon)

I added some things to the bike:
* SW Motech engine guard
* SW Motech bash plate
* Barkbuster handguards

After checking out the Adventure Spec Magadan bags, which I could not get to sit properly on my bike, I ordered a set oft MoskoMoto bags (Backcountry 35l set, 2x 4l addon pockets and the 60l duffel for the back (which I hope to use as a backpack when I park the bike)).
